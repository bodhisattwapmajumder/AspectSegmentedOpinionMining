"room, cleanliness","but it was still a courtyard, very clean and comfortable (especially the bed)."
room,"our room was on the north end of the building, fourth floor, so very quiet; a few jets from airport in the morning."

location,firstly the old town with a vibrant night life is three minutes walk.
cleanliness,the rooms were up to the standard you would expect from this chain but a lot cheaper than downtown.
checkin,staff very friendly and helpful.
cleanliness,"it is in the middle of major building work, it is dirty, dusty, much of the main area is under construction as is much of the accommodation area, and the lift is being used by the contractors so it's dirty."

service,"since i had to talk with marriott to get the points refunded, i made them aware of the lack of notice about the construction and the service failures."
cleanliness,in the resulting dialog with the property it became clear that they just don't care about guest satisfaction.
location,we chose this marriott because of its convenience from the san diego airport and easy access to interstate 5. old town san diego contains a large number of restaurants (almost all with very similar mexican menus) and shops within a few blocks of the hotel.

room,the room was very typical but clean and well equiped.
location,"the bar and restaurant are small but ok. the hotel is well placed for exploring san diego old town and there is a good selection of restaurants to choose from, many being mexican type food but plenty of other choice including steaks and italian pizza."
service,"if you want to go downtown, there is a good trolley / tram service that goes from the station a short walk from the hotel."
"service, value","we did not use it but were told by others that is was good, reliable and value for money."
cleanliness,"we did not have to worry as we were coach bound, but it appeared to have few spaces for guest cars compared to the number of rooms."

location,"despite others' enthusiasm over old town itself, we walked through it in about 20 minutes."
business service,"there are tons of mexican restaurants and stores selling overpriced junk with a southwest motif, but other than a few interesting museums (free) this was just not much of a destination."

cleanliness,i was comfortable.
location,stayed here with a cousin who was visiting from out of town and wanted to spend a couple of days in sd.
"room, cleanliness",room was small and tv wasn't easy to operate.
location,was walking distance to old town which was good.
cleanliness,"the carpet in the room was stained and dirty so that was gross and i feel if a marriott property can't even clean a dirty carpet they should get a poor rating, so that is why i rated it as poor."
cleanliness,paying only $110 a night still doesn't excuse a hotel from being dirty.
"service, cleanliness, location",parking lot next to property was good too since parking isn't so great!
cleanliness,"can't comment on the breakfast, didn't try it."
location,"i stayed here for three nights, and although the location is within walking distant of old town and some great mexican restaurants, until it is updated i would not choose to stay here again."

cleanliness,#NAME?
room,i was given a room on the freeway - which i asked to change.
cleanliness,there were other rooms available when i checked in.
"cleanliness, checkin, location",i'm actually surprised that the check in person didn't think that perhaps a gold member should get a better location.
"room, cleanliness","-the hotel smells - the hallways, and the room i'm in, but i'm not changing rooms again."
location,the location is outstanding.
"cleanliness, location",the lobby and restaurant have been re-done and the rooms are due.

"cleanliness, location",the air conditioner is the old fashioned model in the wall and didn't work very well.
location,the location is nice because you can walk to several restaurants within minutes.
service,we decided to eat their breakfast buffet which was pretty good for the money but the coffee was luke warm.
cleanliness,"marriot if your reading this review ""please do your selves a favor and remodel your hotel rooms""."
"service, business service, location",the location of this property is pretty good if you are on business or pleasure.
location,nice little restaurant and the area (old town) around the hotel has a lot to offer for dining.
"service, checkin, location",pros: location staff friendliness good beds cons: small bathroom vanities (a non-stater if my spouse had been with me..see attached picture) mold in bathroom (see attached picture) this is a marriott.
cleanliness,"for pete's sake, there shouldn't be mold!"
checkin,"the front desk, the general manager, and the housekeeping staff treated us like family for the week we were there."

service,but you will not get a good nights sleep without ear plugs.
location,"not great, but from what i could see, if you park on the street, you are walking several blocks."
value,stayed here for one night only thankfully.
location,"it ha to be said it is in a great location, in walking distance from old town and a short drive to seaworld."
cleanliness,but this doesn't give marriott a licence to leave this hotel in such a state.
"business service, location","firstly the entrance and lobby are nice, with complimentary internet for guests which is great."
room,"we then walked through the aged shabby corridor to our unbelievably low ceilinged room (i am 5""6 and could touch the ceiling with my arm outstretched)."
room,then we spotted the earplugs (one set in a twin room - can anybody say stupid?)
room,"if you do stay here make sure to request a room that does not overlook this road, as it seems they will splash out on lcd tv's but not on soundproof glass."
"room, cleanliness","an effort has been made to modernise the rooms with the flashy tvs etc, but it is not enough, our room could have done with a complete overhaul rather than a tv."
"room, cleanliness","the hotel is very clean, just dated."
value,due to lack of sleep i would have gone crazy if the stay was longer than one night.
room,plus the fact they could not offer us a smoking room or a change in room.

cleanliness,the corridors of the hotel smell and look dated.
cleanliness,the rooms are quite small.
"cleanliness, location",the windows are old and don't block out the loud street noise from the freeway.
"service, value",not a good night's sleep.
service,breakfast buffet (not included) was very good quality with a courteous staff.
location,the location is good for visiting old town - walkable.
"room, cleanliness","1) the place is old inside, 2) the room smells, 3) the room i got is face the high way, 4) the worst part is that window doesn't block any sound, so i couldn't get a good sleep because of hearing the noise from highway all night long."
"business service, value","this place is worst than quality inn or similar places, more like a motel 6. i am not an usual complainer, and my trip is for business, not vacation (thanks god!"
"room, business service, cleanliness","whether you are on business or leisure, stay somewhere else unless you can sleep in the smell and noise room."
"room, cleanliness, location","there was a disgusting smell wafting into the room from the bathroom, most probably from old & leaking plumbing."

checkin,i would stay here again because the staff is superb!
location,location is its main advantage.
location,old town restaurants and shops are a two minute walk away.
"service, value","located right off freeway, so if you are driving it is good for that, easy to find and offers safe parking for $12 per night."
cleanliness,"i have stayed here 3 times now, for pure convenience but not for more than that -- used my husband's and my marriott points so maybe that's why we got rooms near the freeway (loud!)."
business service,"free internet access and coffeemaker in room, 1.50 for water bottles, small pool in shady section on entrance parking lot, strange small dimly lit bathroom, maybe some brighter colors and a renovation would make the hotel a bit more inviting."
location,"quite decent hotel very convenient for the old town which should not be missed, especially at night."

service,good breakfast.

cleanliness,there was audible background freeway noise when i didn't have the aircon fan on.

"room, cleanliness",those with rooms overlooking the freeway may well have caused for complaint - watch your room selection.
location,the location is excellent a couple of blocks from old town and 5 mins walk from the trolley which takes you downtown.
location,with downtown hotels costing about double i'd recommend old town as a location to stay.
value,even the cab fare back late at night was only $16.
location,"old town itself is a pleasant location with plenty of bars, restaurants, etc."
cleanliness,"i didn't and the result was a $47 parking violation which, more or less, negated the street parking saving."
business service,"room was fine (standard courtyard), free internet worked and they had a couple of internet connected pcs in the lobby which took usb keys with printers attached."
"room, service, business service","the exercise room had two joggers, two bikes and a x-trainer and free weights all in good working order."
business service,a nice touch is the free wine and cheese most evenings around 5:00pm in the lobby.
location,didn't eat in the hotel as old town is just up the road and has great choices for both breakfast and evening meals.
location,its a better choice than the mission valley hotels due to the proximity of old town and the trolley.
room,"so, in summary, i'd stay there again but be sure to arrange a room away from the freeway."

cleanliness,didn't bother our sleep at all.
location,two blocks from old town and all the restaurants and shops there.
location,we recommend the old town mexican cafe - there was a huge crowd waiting at the crazy coyote (which i guess means they are good too) and we could not get in.
location,we were withing walking distance to the historic old town neighborhood.
checkin,"this hotel was very clean, and the staff was very friendly!"
location,the prime location directly next to hwy 5 meant it felt like you were sleeping on the hwy.

checkin,the staff was vey friendly and helpful.

location,"we (my wife, 1 yr old son, and i) stayed here over valentine's weekend."
location,the hotel is about 3 blocks away from old town.
location,"so, if that's the part of san diego that you'll be spending most of your time it's a fabulous location."
location,"however, you can take the trolley tour from old town and see many of the other popular tourist sites (which we did and we would recommend it for anyone looking for a quick overview of the city)."
"value, location","it's a 3-star hotel at best, but it's still a great place to stay for the value."
checkin,the employees were all very friendly and accommodating.
cleanliness,"even though the lobby was busy with people checking in, they were happy to answer my questions about the area and didn't rush me off."
cleanliness,the rooms are standard and unspectacular.
"room, cleanliness","but, it was clean."
cleanliness,"but, the noise didn't affect us at all."
cleanliness,we parked in the garage for our stay and from what we observed there weren't a lot of open spots on the street.
business service,the rooms have free wifi.
"service, location",they do have restaurant but we didn't try it (harney sushi down the street was great; cafe coyote had mediocre mexican food and poor service).
"service, cleanliness","the standard going rate for their rooms is a little high, but luckily we got a good deal for much less."
location,i just returned from a 3 day conference at the old town mariott courtyard.
room,i had a conference rate of $159 per night for a king room.
room,"the hotel is older so there is some room noise - i could hear the guy in the room next to me coughing, and doors slamming in the hallway, but the rooms have been updated and are very nice except for the trim around doors and floor."
"room, cleanliness","the bed was supremely comfortable: it had a clean duvet instead of the usually icky bedspread and tons of pillows, both down and foam."

"room, service, checkin",room service was fast and again the server was very polite and friendly.
location,"the food was fine, but if i hadn't been alone i would have walked to old town for dinner instead."
location,"the hotel is a block away from old town, so if that is your destination in san diego, you can't beat this hotel."
location,it is easily the nicest hotel near old town.
"room, cleanliness, location","the pool area was very small and right in clear view of the conference rooms, lobby, hotel restaurant and parking lot."
"room, business service, cleanliness",i didn't use the pool because i would have had to swim in clear view of people sitting on the patio having business meetings and/or working on their laptops.
business service,i only saw one family while i was here - it was all business people so i probably wouldn't stay here during the week unless i was on business.
location,"spent seven great days in the courtyard old town san diego, from christmas day to new year's day and had a fabulous stay."
location,"the hotel is very centrally located to all that is san diego -- beaches, sea world, coronado, and, of course, old town, just to name a few areas!"
location,"in fact, it is within walking distance of all old town attractions, as well as the trolley that runs throughout san diego proper."
"service, cleanliness",the rooms are typical courtyard and predictable (which i consider a good thing).
service,"either way, these are not really good options to getting to the pool/hot tub area."
value,"as other reviewers have mentioned, the parking is $12 per night if you choose to park with the hotel."
value,"however, street parking is typically not an issue, so i opted to park on the street and never failed to find a spot, regardless of the time of day or night."
location,"this property obviously did begin as a courtyard, as is readily apparent upon arrival, but it does fit the old town look and feel."
value,"this particular neighborhood does seem a bit questionable at night, but i never encountered any problems, but on a few occasions there were older men just roaming around on the streets surrounding the property."
room,"security does seem adequate at the hotel, as there was always a night guard on duty and the doors only accessible with a room key after 10 p.m. bottom line...i would not hesitate to stay at this property again, but as many others have stressed, please request a room facing away from interstate 5 -- quite busy and noisy if you are placed in one of those rooms."
location,location was great.
location,"we spent the day walking around balboa, then took a short drive to our hotel and walked around old town san diego, and crawled back to the room after a few bar visits."

location,"if you enjoy the courtyard, this is pretty much like most.. not a great bargain, but not bad either."

"room, value",yes we also had a freeway view we just keep the vent on all night and we did not hear the freeway at all.
room,"when my husband booked our room a month in advance, he asked that we be placed in a room that was not on the freeway side."
room,so what room did they give us?

checkin,the staff were very friendly and helpful.
location,we were within walking distance of all the pubs and restaurants of olde town.
service,we had breakfast one morning and it was very good - buffet style.
room,"one small complaint - the bathroom area in the room is a bit cramped - ok for a single person staying in the room but not really large enough to cater for 2 people's toothbrushes, lotions and such like."
location,i would recommend this hotel for location and comfort.
value,not bad for it's price as hotels in san diego can be very expensive.
location,the big plus is the short walk to the sights and eateries in old town - love that cafe coyote!
cleanliness,"it is right alongside 'the' i-5, so you may want to opt for the quieter side street rooms."
"service, cleanliness",the open-air breakfast area is nice if it isn't too chilly outside.
checkin,"oddly enough, one of the memorable parts of our trip involved the cleaning staff."
value,i paid $189 for a room that definetly wasn't worth it!

location,"indeed, this is a great spot to stay in."
checkin,the staff was very nice and accomodating i must say.
location,"i traveled to san diego for a wedding, and decided on this courtyard hotel based on it's location, and i was very happy with my decision!"

value,"overall, the only downside to this hotel is the price."
value,"if you are staying during the week, obviously the prices will be considerately lower, but the average weekend night will run $200+."
"cleanliness, location","but if you are in need of a comfortable and clean hotel in a great location, this is defintely the place to host your san diego stay."

checkin,i went down to the front desk and spoke personnally to the manager who was very friendly and said he could move me next day.
room,new room was on other side of hotel with standard room amenities.

room,exercise room is located off hotel in parking garage.

location,the only advantage to this hotel was it was very close to old town and to the lovely restaurants there.
location,stayed at the courtyard old town for 3 nights on a business trip on oct 15-18. got in to san diego around 11:30 a.m. but was not allowed to check in early.
checkin,"the hotel front desk was not friendly, curt, and appeared to care less."
checkin,"came back to check in at around 4 pm after ""killing time"" in the gaslamp area."
value,"the room, for the price paid ($239 a night +$25.00 tax) was small."
room,i asked for a room with a king bed but was told there was none available so i had to settle for a room with 2 queen beds.
business service,the hotel advertised high-speed internet but conveniently did not disclose that this was not wireless.
"service, business service","even with an ethernet cable, the high speed internet service was not reliable."
room,the hotel is located next to the freeway and i got a room facing it so it was pretty noisy once you turned your tv off to go to sleep.
"room, value, location","on my second night, i called the front desk for a wake up call at 5:15 a.m. but did not get the call until 5:30. on the positive side, the cleaning crew did an great job as the room and the bathroom were always spotless."
service,the hotel served breakfast a la carte and/or all you can eat breakfast for $10-12 depending on your choice.
service,"another positive note, breakfast was good although if your choice is continental breakfast, i think $8.95 is pretty steep since most other hotels provide that free."

room,"my husband and i booked a room here for one night in oct. and just let me start by saying the young guy at the desk who checked us in was very, very nice, helpful, respectful and even upgraded us to a suite, we were coming back from a 4 day cruise to mexico and wanted to stay in old town san diego for a fifth night before flying back home to northern calif. i did look at this property online before booking and it seemed fine, however, interstate 5 runs right behind the property and even though we requested a room facing the front, we could still hear the noise all night long, in addition to that we were on a romantic trip and realized shortly after we got there that this is a very nice property for business executive's, not romance, our suite even had a conference table!"
"room, business service","like i said very nice property for business executive's, nice business room's & suite's, but not for quite romantic evening's"
room,"like many people say, the noise from i-5 freeway is pretty loud if you have a room that faces the road."

location,"a well maintained facility with brilliant staff who are highly attentive and professional great location for old town shops and resturants, and a place to take the ""hop on and off"" trolley tours."

cleanliness,"the hotel is new looking and attractive, but the rooms are small and noisy, if you're unfortunate enough to have one of the rooms that are directly facing the freeway."
value,"yes, i could have asked for another room, but once you get settled in at night with 2 small kids, trust me, its not worth it."
cleanliness,"i didn't want to pay the $15 parking fee, so i parked on the street."
